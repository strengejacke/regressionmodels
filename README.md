# Overview of R Modelling Packages

This is an overview of R packages and functions for fitting different
types of regression models. For each row, the upper cells in the last
column (*packages and functions*) refer to “simple” models, while the
lower cells refer to their mixed models counterpart (if available and
known).

This overview raises no claims towards completeness of available
modelling packages. Rather, it shows commonly or more often used
packages, but there a plenty of other packages as well (that might even
perform better in doing those mentioned tasks - if you’re aware of such
packages or think that an important package or function is missing,
please [file an
issue](https://github.com/strengejacke/regressionmodels/issues)).

  - `*` indicates that for the mixed models functions the same
    response-type and family should be used as for their `glm`
    counterpart.

  - Note that ratios or proportions from **count data**, like
    `cbind(successes, failures)`, are modelled as logistic regression
    with `glm(cbind(successes, failures), family=binomial())`, while
    ratios from **continuous data** (where the response ranges from zero
    to one) are modelled using beta-regression.

  - Usually, zero-inflated models are used when 0 or 1 come from a
    separate process or category. However, when the 0/1 values are most
    consistent with censoring rather than with a separate
    category/process, the ordered beta regression is probably a better
    choice (i.e., 0 mean “below detection”, not “something qualitatively
    different happened”) (Source:
